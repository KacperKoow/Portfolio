    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a graduate in Electronics, where I had the opportunity to work with
      programming languages such as Java, Python, and C#.
    </p>
    <p>
      For over a year, I have been intensively developing my skills in web
      technologies, with a particular focus on Angular, JavaScript, and
      TypeScript. My goal is to expand my expertise to include Spring Boot and
      Java to become a full-stack developer.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the near future, I plan to start studying at the Polish-Japanese
      Academy of Information Technology in the field of Computer Science,
      specializing in Software Engineering, Business Processes, and Databases. I
      am an ambitious and dynamically developing programmer with a passion for
      new technologies and a strong interest in advancing within the IT
      industry.
