    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a graduate in Electronics, where I had the opportunity to work with
      programming languages such as Java, Python, and C#.
    </p>
    <p>
      For over a year, I have been intensively developing my skills in web
      technologies, with a particular focus on Angular, JavaScript, and
      TypeScript. My goal is to expand my expertise to include Spring Boot and
      Java to become a full-stack developer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Starting in October, I will begin my studies at the Polish-Japanese
      Academy of Information Technology, pursuing a degree in Computer Science
      with a specialization in Software Engineering, Business Processes, and
      Databases. I am an ambitious and continuously developing programmer with a
      passion for new technologies and a strong drive to grow within the IT
      industry.
